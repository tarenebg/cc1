**Cold- related Mortality Dwarfs Heat- related Mortality in Portugal**

http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/jan/a4.php

Heat-related death rates are often cited as major causes of concern related to climate change; however, this article discusses a paper proving that death related to cold weather was far greater than heat-related mortality in Portugal, and further extrapolated that cold-related deaths should be the main goal of climate policy. This paper review prompted me to further investigate the claim that cold-related deaths pose a far greater risk than heat-related deaths, which is ultimately a fundamental misrepresentation of data seeing as climate change does pose an indisputable risk of increased heat-related deaths.  

**It's the Sun. Not you. Not CO2.**

This post describes the ways in which solar wind and disturbances are largely responsible for climate change seeing as the human contributions to atmospheric composition alteration are far less notable. I was peripherally aware of the common perspective amongst climate change skeptics that the sun is responsible for climate change, but I had not explored the mechanisms they believe to be responsible, and this post prompted me to reconsider my understanding of the external factors that could contribute to climate change beyond human contributions.    

**Was the Earth Warmer Before? Sea Level Higher? CO2 Higher?**

This paper covered a broad range of climate change facts, myths, and beliefs, but I focused on the section titled "Was the Earth Warmer Before? Sea Level Higher? CO2 Higher?", which discussed how the global sea levels were higher, temperatures were warmer, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were increased over different historic geologic periods. Although I was already aware of the historical data showing that Earth has undergone previous cycles of global warming and cooling, this helped me consider how alarmist views on climate change have resulted in my doom-and-gloom perspective on the potential outcomes based on our current trajectory.
 

**Analysis: Hurricanes Have Not Gotten More Intense, Frequent Over Past 170 Years**

Although hurricanes and extreme weather events are often explained as increasingly common due to climate change and global warming, this article stated that hurricane frequency is actually controlled by the Atlantic oceanic variability. I did believe that climate change was making hurricanes more frequent, or at least more severe, so considering the possibility that this is a short-term, largely internal-influenced increase was a different perspective on my understanding of how climate change impacts hurricanes, even though further research ultimately did show that climate change will increase tropical storm frequency and intensity. 

**New NASA Study: Earth has been trapping heat at an alarming new rate**

This article examines Earth's radiative energy budget through the CERES satellite instrumentation, and how claiming that the increase of our energy imbalance is "unprecedented" is not a valid claim based on our knowledge of energy flow and the natural climate cycle. I appreciated the consideration of the natural climate cycle and historical analysis in examining this subject, which I already heard about, and I did reconsider the way claims can be worded to sound increasingly dangerous when the objective research is rephrased to support a specific perspective. 


# Evaluation of No.1 Claim

The article “Cold-related Mortality Dwarfs Heat-related Mortality in Portugal” from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change (2021) reviews a recent paper that suggests cold weather poses far greater risks than heat. This rhetoric aligns with the climate skeptic beliefs that climate change does not pose any imminent risk for human life as we know it, despite extensive research suggesting otherwise. 

The article begins by explaining that cold weather is far deadlier than hot weather. This continues to a review of the paper “Modelling climate change impacts on attributable-related deaths and demographic changes in the largest metropolitan area in Portugal: A time-series analysis”, which looks at daily variation in temperature and overall mortality near Lisbon, Portugal (Rodrigues, Santana and Rocha, 2020). Rodrigues, Santana and Rocha (2020) find that cold weather poses a far greater risk as indicated by the thirty-day cumulative relative risks of mortality compared to temperature; essentially, the proportion of deaths from cold weather are far greater than hot weather (Rodrigues, Santana and Rocha, 2020). Based on these findings, the main article suggests that cold-related deaths should be the focus of research and policy (Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, 2021). 

This paper, however, does not tell the complete story; while cold-related deaths are undeniably dangerous, the decrease of cold-related deaths does not account for the increase of heat-related deaths (US EPA a, 2017). Increased greenhouse gas concentrations lead to higher average and extreme temperatures, which will result in premature heat-related deaths (USGCRP, 2016). Abnormally hot summers and record-breaking heat waves have been in a steady upward trend, which results in increased heat-related deaths (US EPA b, 2016). Given that heat-related deaths are often publicized extensively to show the extent of climate change’s impact, this is an extremely relevant subject. 

This claim does bring up some good points about cold-related deaths decreasing with climate. The article would appear to target a general audience with some basic science understanding, seeing as it does explain the statistical analysis of the original paper; however, it does appear to be advocating for a climate change skeptic perspective. The author is not stated explicitly, but the website is for the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change. Its mission statement is to determine the impacts of increasing carbon dioxide by separating the emotional aspect from global change. The website and its graphics do not suggest that this is a scholarly or organization website, but rather a more personal blog based on the organization and overall content. 

The information in this post does come from a peer reviewed journal and contain relevant statistics that show how the cumulative relative risk of temperature is greater at low temperatures. The post was published in 2021 based on research from 2020, so the data is not out-dated. While the primary source from Rodrigues, Santana and Rocha (2020) finds that there are more cold-related deaths than heat-related deaths in the Lisbon area, this is not satisfactory evidence to support the claim that policy should aim to minimize cold weather deaths instead of focusing on climate-change driven heat-related deaths. Additional sources and a wider sample area would be required to satisfactorily support the claims. 

Increased mortality associated with cold weather does not indicate a direct correlation to heat-related deaths being unimportant; rather, both factors would need to be considered from an impartial perspective. Claiming that cold-related deaths prove that policies should shift away from global warming is not a plausible claim based on the limited data provided, despite analysis indicating that cold-related mortality also poses a threat.

# Common Themes
Despite widespread criticism of “fake news”, it is understandable that climate claim articles can easily draw in the reader to understand a different perspective. After all, they are commonly rooted in environmental and climate science and are biased towards a specific perspective. Hasty generalization was often used to draw conclusions based on limited resources, as there was not satisfactory data to apply findings about one specific study to a broad group. I observed this broad generalization in nearly every article, which often had one hand-picked source to back up their claims while ignoring any other supporting research. The claims were also frequently extended to broadly apply to all climate situations, as opposed to the region of interest from evidence, which is not an accurate justification. Many of the climate claims and their supporting arguments follow a common thread of not having adequate evidence to back up controversial and strong claims.
